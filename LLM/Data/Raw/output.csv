AAPL,Apple extends its privacy leadership with new updates across its platforms,"Jun 10, 2024","Private Cloud Compute sets a new standard for privacy in artificial intelligence CUPERTINO, Calif., June 10, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apple® today announced new updates across its platforms that help empower users and keep them in control of their data. Private Cloud Compute extends the industry-leading protections of iPhone® to the cloud, so that users don’t have to choose between powerful intelligence grounded in their personal context and strong privacy protections. Apple also raised the bar for privacy with new features, such as locked and hidden apps, aimed at helping users protect sensitive areas of their phones. Apple introduced additional features designed with privacy and security in mind, including categorization in Mail, Messages via satellite, and presenter preview. ""Private Cloud Compute allows Apple Intelligence to process complex user requests with groundbreaking privacy,"" said Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of Software Engineering. ""We’ve extended iPhone’s industry-leading security to the cloud, with what we believe is the most advanced security architecture ever deployed for cloud AI at scale. Private Cloud Compute uses your data only to fulfill your request, and never stores it, making sure it’s never accessible to anyone, including Apple. And we’ve designed the system so that independent experts can verify these protections."" Superior Privacy for AI Capabilities Apple Intelligence™, the personal intelligence system that puts powerful generative models right at the core of iPhone, iPad®, and Mac®, makes a user’s most personal devices even more useful and delightful. A cornerstone of Apple Intelligence is on-device processing, which delivers personal intelligence without collecting users’ data. In those times when a user needs models that are larger than what can fit in their pocket today, Private Cloud Compute allows Apple Intelligence to flex and scale its computational capacity, drawing on larger, server-based models to handle more complex requests, all while protecting user privacy. When a user makes a request, Apple Intelligence analyzes whether it can be processed on device. If it needs greater computational capacity, it can draw on Private Cloud Compute, which will send only the data that is relevant to the task to be processed on Apple silicon servers. When requests are routed to Private Cloud Compute, data is not stored or made accessible to Apple, and is only used to fulfill the user’s requests. The Apple silicon servers that form the foundation of Private Cloud Compute provide unprecedented cloud security. This starts with the Secure Enclave, which protects critical encryption keys on the server just as it does on a user’s iPhone, while Secure Boot ensures the OS running on the server is signed and verified, just like in iOS. Trusted Execution Monitor makes sure only signed and verified code runs, and attestation enables a user’s device to securely verify the identity and configuration of a Private Cloud Compute cluster before sending a request. And to verify Apple’s privacy promise, independent experts can inspect the code that runs on Private Cloud Compute servers.                       "
AAPL,Apple empowers developers and fuels innovation with new tools and resources,"Jun 10, 2024","Enhancements to Xcode and Swift, combined with new APIs, offer developers expanded capabilities for creating high-quality apps CUPERTINO, Calif., June 10, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apple® today unveiled a suite of innovative new tools and resources designed to enable developers worldwide to create more powerful and efficient apps across all Apple platforms. With Xcode® 16, developers can save time in their development process and get more done thanks to features like Swift® Assist and predictive code completion. New and expanded APIs give developers the tools to advance their apps and introduce exciting features. ""At Apple, we are dedicated to providing developers everywhere with the cutting-edge technologies and resources to build incredible apps,"" said Susan Prescott, Apple’s vice president of Worldwide Developer Relations. ""With thoughtful innovation behind Xcode 16 and our latest platform APIs, we’ve created the best tools for developers to create outstanding apps. We’re excited to see what they build next."" Xcode 16 Xcode 16 sets a new standard for developer productivity, offering features and performance enhancements that empower developers to build exceptional apps faster than ever before. Swift Assist serves as a companion for all of a developer’s coding tasks, so they can focus on higher-level problems and solutions. It’s seamlessly integrated into Xcode, and knows the latest software development kits (SDKs) and Swift language features, so developers will always get the latest code features that blend perfectly into their projects. With Swift Assist, tasks like exploring new frameworks and experimenting with new ideas are just one request away. Swift Assist uses a powerful model that runs in the cloud — and like all Apple developer services, it is built with privacy and security in mind. Developers’ code is only used to process requests and never stored on servers, and Apple will not use it to train machine learning models. The new predictive code completion engine in Xcode uses a unique model specifically trained for Swift and Apple SDKs, and can suggest the code developers need. Code completion is powered entirely by Apple silicon and machine learning enhancements in macOS® Sequoia, and runs locally on a developer’s device — meaning that code is kept completely private, and developers can receive relevant suggestions quickly even when working offline. Xcode previews now offer a new dynamic linking architecture that uses the same build artifacts for previews and code execution, making for a smoother and more productive workflow when switching between the two.

MSFT,Billionaires Just Poured About $67 Billion Into These 5 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks,"Jun 25, 2024","Artificial intelligence (AI) has the power to revolutionize our lives -- at least if big tech is to be believed. Plenty of products already hit the market, like ChatGPT, and while they have made a splash, the technology's true impact has yet to be felt. That promise of more to come is driving incredible growth for companies involved in AI. Top fund managers are snapping up shares of these businesses as they try to capture as much value from the technology's explosive growth as possible. Funds with more than $100 million in assets under management need to report their trades every quarter to the Securities and Exchange Commission on form 13F. Lucky for us, it's public knowledge. Knowing where the ""smart money"" is flowing can help you make sound decisions, but it should only be part of your information gathering. It turns out that the smart money isn't always so smart -- and besides, there are plenty of managers selling shares of all of the following five stocks. To perhaps no one's surprise, the company with the most hedge-fund buys was Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). It captured the investing world's imagination after positioning itself as the go-to chipmaker for all things AI. Its revenue growth has been incredible, and it's done it all while keeping costs relatively low. The chart below measuring the growth of its net income over the past three years shows the point where AI took off. Fund managers bought $15.9 billion worth of shares last quarter. The biggest purchases were $6.2 billion from Vanguard and $1.8 billion by BlackRock. One of my favorite AI plays, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), runs the largest cloud computing operation in the world, Amazon Web Service (AWS), controlling over 30% of the cloud market and is investing heavily to maintain this share. It partners with Nvidia to outfit its data centers with the latest and most powerful chips, and it put $4 billion into OpenAI competitor Anthropic. Fund managers bought $14.4 billion worth of shares last quarter. The biggest purchases were $2.5 billion (Vanguard) and $1.9 billion (BlackRock). Another solid AI play, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), backs OpenAI, the maker of the most popular AI application, ChatGPT. When OpenAI released ChatGPT-3 to the public, it became the most quickly adopted technology in history. For much of the public, ChatGPT is as far as their knowledge of AI goes, unaware of Anthropic's offering or Alphabet's. Microsoft is No. 2 in the cloud and has been slowly eating into AWS' market share. Its partnership with OpenAI means Microsoft has the most-used AI application in the world on its servers. And Microsoft is also outfitting them with Nvidia chips.                "
MSFT,The most important stock market chart of 2024: Morning Brief,"Jun 25, 2024","This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings The stock market in 2024 has been defined by one theme: AI. And not just because people only want to talk about AI, but the market's performance has hinged on it too. In a weekly note to clients published Monday, strategists at the BlackRock Investment Institute led by Jean Boivin highlighted the following chart, which shows just how much tech has dominated the market's performance since 2023. Since the start of last year, the S&P 500 is up a robust 42%. This return is nothing to scoff at, with the annualized rate of that return standing near 26%, almost triple the index's average annual gain over time. But if we isolate the performance of tech stocks, we see a clearer picture emerge. Over that same period, the S&P 500 Tech index, which houses Nvidia (NVDA), the market's main character at the moment, as well as Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), and two other key AI beneficiaries — Broadcom (AVGO) and AMD (AMD) — is up 100%. (As Jared Blikre flagged last week, however, investors buying the most popular tech ETF have missed out on some of this performance.) Excluding the tech sector, the S&P 500 is up a respectable, but much closer to historically average, 24% over that period. ""The concentration in US tech stocks is a feature, not a flaw, of the AI theme,"" BlackRock wrote. As the analysts noted, stocks in the tech sector collectively grew their earnings 23% over last year in the first quarter. According to data from FactSet, earnings for the S&P 500 as a whole grew 5.9% over the prior year in Q1. Over the long run, corporate earnings are the most important driver of stock prices. And with tech companies currently growing their profits at a rate far exceeding the index's average, this outperformance hardly looks exceptional. ""Strong balance sheets are also a reason we like tech, and we are less concerned about valuation metrics,"" BlackRock added. ""Free cash flows — excluding operational costs — as a share of sales are nearly double for tech than for the broader market, and tech has the largest profit margins across sectors, LSEG Datastream data show. Plus, many top tech names are highly profitable and cash-flush, allowing them to fund the buildout of AI infrastructure such as data centers."" As we highlighted over the weekend, one of the key themes the equity strategy team at JPMorgan flagged coming out of first quarter earnings was an emphasis from corporate management teams on continuing AI investments.

MSFT,EU charges Microsoft with abusive bundling of Teams with Office,"Jun 25, 2024","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators on Tuesday charged Microsoft (MSFT) of illegally bundling its chat and video app Teams with its Office product and say that recent moves by the U.S. tech giant to unbundle the package were insufficient and more needed to be done. ""Microsoft has breached EU antitrust rules by tying its communication and collaboration product Teams to its popular productivity applications included in its suites for businesses Office 365 and Microsoft 365,"" the European Commission said in a statement. ""The Commission preliminarily finds that these changes are insufficient to address its concerns and that more changes to Microsoft's conduct are necessary to restore competition,"" it said, referring to Microsoft's unbundling of Teams from Office announced in recent months. The move by the EU competition watchdog was triggered by a 2020 complaint by Salesforce-owned competing workspace messaging app Slack. Teams was added to Office 365 in 2017 for free and subsequently replaced Skype for Business. Its popularity soared during the pandemic due in part to its video conferencing. Microsoft said it would work to find solutions to address EU regulators' concerns. (Reporting by Foo Yun Chee)"
MSFT,"Microsoft breached antitrust rules by bundling Teams with office software, European Union says","Jun 25, 2024","LONDON (AP) — Microsoft violated European Union antitrust rules with “possibly abusive” practices by tying its Teams messaging and videoconferencing app to its widely used business software, the bloc said. The European Commission said Monday it informed Microsoft of its preliminary view that the U.S. tech giant has been “restricting competition” by bundling Teams with core office productivity applications such as Office 365 and Microsoft 365. The commission, the 27-nation bloc's top antitrust enforcer, said it suspects Microsoft might have granted Teams a “distribution advantage” by not giving customers a choice on whether to have Teams when they purchased the software. The advantage might have been widened by limits on the ability of rival messaging apps to work with Microsoft software, it said. “We are concerned that Microsoft may be giving its own communication product Teams an undue advantage over competitors, by tying it to its popular productivity suites for businesses,” Margrethe Vestager, the commission's executive vice-president for competition policy, said in a statement. “And preserving competition for remote communication and collaboration tools is essential as it also fosters innovation on these markets.” Microsoft made some changes last year in an effort to head off an penalty, including offering the software packages without Teams for European customers. But the commission said Tuesday the changes are not enough to address its concerns and that it needs to do more to ""restore competition."" “Having unbundled Teams and taken initial interoperability steps, we appreciate the additional clarity provided today and will work to find solutions to address the Commission‘s remaining concerns.” Microsoft President Brad Smith said in a prepared statement. In April, the company also gave customers worldwide the option to get Microsoft 365 and Office 365 without Teams. The two software suites include programs like Word, Excel and Outlook. Microsoft now has a chance to respond to the accusations, formally known as a statement of objections, before the commission makes its final decision. The company could face a fine worth up to 10% of its annual global revenue, or be forced to carry out “remedies"" to satisfy the competition concerns. The commission opened its investigation in July 2023 after rival Slack Technologies, which makes popular workplace messaging software, filed a complaint with Brussels. A second company, videoconferencing software maker Alfaview, filed a second complaint. Rival messaging platform Slack, owned by business software maker Salesforce, has alleged that Microsoft abused its market dominance to eliminate competition — in violation of EU laws — by illegally combining Teams with its Office suite, which includes Word, Excel and Outlook. “The Statement of Objections issued today by the European Commission is a win for customer choice and an affirmation that Microsoft’s practices with Teams have harmed competition,” said Sabastian Niles, president & chief legal officer at Salesforce. “We appreciate the Commission’s thorough investigation of Slack’s complaint and urge the Commission to move towards a swift, binding, and effective remedy that restores free and fair choice and promotes competition, interoperability, and innovation in the digital ecosystem.”"
MSFT,2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Could Go Parabolic,"Jun 25, 2024","The artificial intelligence (AI) market has surged since the start of 2023. The debut of OpenAI's ChatGPT illustrated key advances in generative AI technology and demonstrated its potential to change all aspects of tech. As a result, an array of companies have ventured into the AI space, attempting to take slices of a pie that was worth close to $200 billion last year, and that Grand View Research forecasts will grow at a compound annual rate of 37% through 2030. And even though many stocks involved have already experienced meteoric rises, the potential of AI suggests it's not too late to invest in the trend and accrue major gains over the long term. Tech giants have barely scratched the surface of what's possible with AI, suggesting now could be the best time to invest in the companies pushing the industry forward. So, here are two artificial intelligence stocks that could go parabolic. You might be surprised to see me recommending Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), given that its stock is down 39% year to date. However, the company appears to be staging a comeback that could send its share price soaring in the coming years. After a challenging decade, Intel is restructuring its business to regain its competitive edge. The company is investing heavily in AI, debuting a range of new AI processors this year. Meanwhile, the chip giant is expanding its manufacturing division, a move that it believes will help it reach non-GAAP gross margins of 60% and save it between $8 billion and $10 billion by 2025. Restructuring is costly, and it will take time for Intel to see significant returns on its investment. However, recent results indicate the company is on the right track. In the first quarter, its revenue increased 9% year over year to $13 billion -- a sharp contrast to the 16% decline in sales it posted in 2023. The chipmaker also delivered non-GAAP earnings of $0.18 per share, beating expectations by about $0.04 per share. Intel has a lot of work ahead as it goes up against Nvidia in the AI chip market and expands its foundry division. However, it's on a promising growth trajectory. In addition to positive earnings, the company's trailing 12-month free cash flow has increased by about $2 billion since January. Trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 28 and a stock price that's near its lowest point in months, Intel is a screaming buy this month. Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) share price has popped by more than 10% since last month as Wall Street grew bullish on the company again. The iPhone maker hit some speed bumps over the past year, when tumbling product sales led to declines in revenue. However, recent developments gave investors a peek into Apple's plan to boost product revenue with the help of AI.             "

AMZN,Amazon is a top pick: Wedbush analyst on digital advertising,"Jun 23, 2024","Amazon (AMZN) could be going through its own post-COVID ""Renaissance period,"" according to Wedbush Securities Equity Research Managing Director Scott Devitt. Devitt joins Yahoo Finance's Market Domination, commenting on Amazon's reaccelerating growth in the digital advertising space. ""What you're finding is these data repositories of media content are now being brought to life,"" Devitt tells Yahoo Finance. ""And that's going to continue to enhance the advertising models as these retail companies — some of which do it directly, like Amazon — providing their own demand-side platform for their retail media inventory to third party advertisers and many retailers that don't have the capacity to do that.""

AMZN,Amazon ‘botched government relations’,"Jun 23, 2024","At the end of 2023, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and 17 state attorneys general sued Amazon for alleged illegal monopolies and antitrust violations. Author and WSJ journalist Dana Mattioli joined Opening Bid with Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi to breakdown what this means considering Amazon's influence on both the worlds of retail and tech. She and Sozzi speculated on how Amazon's (AMZN) practices are even contributing to inflation: 'We’re all paying more because of Amazon’s power in e-commerce.' In her new book ""The Everything War: Amazon’s Ruthless Quest to Own the World and Remake Corporate Power"" she covers rank and yank practices, culture shifts under Jeff Bezos, and combative relationships with regulatory bodies. For full episodes of Opening Bid, watch on our website or listen on your favorite podcast platform. Has Amazon learned, have they learned from the observations in your book? Are they still ranking and yanking human beings outside of the company? They are still doing yanking rank. Um They've also had this really combative way about them as it relates to press, but also government relations. You know, this is a company that's firmly in the regulatory spotlight. You know, jurisdictions around the world have said that they might be a monopoly, including the FTC and instead of, you know, doing what typical company would do, which is, you know, make friends of regulators or at least lobby them in a way that's constructive. They've really botched government relations and been, have been combative, which doesn't make any sense. It doesn't because, you know, they could be broken up as a result of this lawsuit and, and in the midst of the, you know, the FTC calling them a monopoly, they've deleted all their signal messages for two years related to M and A and antitrust, right? So these are not the sorts of things that build bridges and sort of help you make your case when you're in the regulatory spotlight for those not familiar why is the FCFTC contending that Amazon is monopoly. Yeah, it's really fascinating to Dan's point. The seller base is really important to Amazon. This is, you know, where 60% of all of their retail sales come from is third party sellers. And you know, Amazon for years has been where 40% of all online shopping in the US happen. So sellers need to be there. And for the last decade, they've, they've known that and they've been able to extract more rent from these sellers. So for instance, a decade ago, on average, Amazon took 90% of every dollar a seller made in revenue on Amazon today.                     "
AMZN,Sports has to feed into a streamer's 'ecosystem': Kevin Mayer,"Jun 22, 2024","As streaming platforms lean heavier into ad-supported subscription tiers and live sports broadcasts, what does this mean for linear TV which has been on the decline for years? Candle Media Co-Founder and Co-CEO Kevin Mayer joins Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi at the 2024 Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity to discuss where sports streaming fits into the broader game plan for major streaming service providers. Mayer calls sports and news ""the last bastion of pay TV"" with the future of linear television mainly coming down to sports. ""The outlook for pay television isn't great, and when sports viewers find other opportunities to watch sports, I think you'll see a continuation of that decline and a collapse, frankly, of that environment,"" Mayer says. ""But broadcast is a bit different. That doesn't depend on pay TV to get delivered to households there in every single household. And I do think you'll just see a different type of programming coming on there."" Mayer's resume also includes his tenure as the CEO of TikTok, COO of the popular app's parent company ByteDance, and the chairman of Disney's (DIS) Direct-to-Consumer & International segment.

If we're having this conversation 10 years from now, what does the local TV station look like? Linear TV is in is in secular decline. I think there's no question that at least the pay TV elements of linear television are being supplanted by streaming. And I think that, you know, the last bastion of TV has always been sports and news news. You can get in a lot of different streaming, uh, and and you can get them just on the Web and you can get news in a lot of different places. So I'm not sure that's going to continue to be a major driver of pay TV. So it's really down to sports. And I think you know, ESPN has announced that they're going over the top of their sports streaming. There's they're in a joint venture with Warner Brothers and Fox to do the same thing. I think that you'll see sports migrating from pay TV in a very, very substantial way also to streaming. So I think the the outlook for pay television isn't great. Um, and when when sports viewers find other opportunities to watch sports, I think you'll see a continuation of that of that decline and a collapse, frankly, of that environment.
